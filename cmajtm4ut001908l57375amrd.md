**From Lagos to the Moon: How I Became a Voice for Global Space Policy**

When I traded Lagos’ bustling markets for Strasbourg’s cobblestone streets, I thought I was just joining a startup. Instead, I found myself on a Zoom call with the United Nations, advocating for the future of lunar exploration-all while representing an industry, a nation, and a vision I hadn’t fully grasped until that moment.

## **An Unlikely Journey: From Local Developer to UN Delegate**

My story starts in Nigeria, where tech innovation thrives despite infrastructure gaps. When I joined Lee Space, a company incubated at the International Space University (ISU), I imagined building software for satellites, rockets and space assets, not policy frameworks for the Moon. But life has a way of catapulting you into unexpected orbits.

One Tuesday morning, an email arrived: *“Invitation to present at the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS).”*

## **The GEGSLA Framework: A Rulebook for Moon Villages**

Let’s rewind. **GEGSLA**\-the Global Expert Group on Sustainable Lunar Activities-isn’t just another acronym. It’s a multi-year collaboration between countries, space agencies, companies, and academics to answer one question: *How do we prevent the Moon from becoming a cosmic Wild West?*

Imagine this: private companies mining lunar ice, nations setting up research bases, and startups offering Moon tourism-all within a decade. Without rules, we’d face chaos: conflicting land claims, environmental damage, and missed opportunities for collaboration.

The GEGSLA Framework is our collective attempt to avoid that future. Think of it as a mix of *“guidelines for polite neighbors”* and *“technical standards for survival.”* Here’s what it tackles:

1. **Transparency:** Share your lunar plans so others don’t accidentally crash into your rover.
    
2. **Environmental Care:** Protect the Moon’s delicate dust (which is sharper than glass and ruins equipment).
    
3. **Interoperability:** Ensure everyone’s tech plays nice-like making sure a Japanese lander can dock with a European habitat.
    
4. **Inclusivity:** Invite developing nations to the table *before* the menu is set.
    

## **Why I Spoke for Nigeria-and Why It Matters**

When I unmuted myself on that Zoom call, I wasn’t just representing my company. I was there for Nigeria, a country with a budding space program but limited resources. Here’s the hard truth: **if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.**

Historically, space has been dominated by a few wealthy nations. But the Moon is different. It’s a global commons, and its resources-like water ice in shadowed craters-could unlock deep-space exploration for *all* of humanity. My key message was simple:

*“Developing nations aren’t charity cases. We’re contributors. Involve us in drafting the rules, and you’ll get better rules.”*

For example, Nigeria’s experience leapfrogging landlines to build a mobile-first economy could inspire creative solutions for lunar infrastructure. But if we’re excluded from early discussions, that potential is lost.

## **The Industry Paradox: Innovators Need Guardrails**

As a private sector rep, I faced a tightrope walk. Companies want freedom to innovate, but chaos on the Moon would hurt everyone. The GEGSLA Framework strikes a balance:

* **For Startups:** Clear rules reduce risk for investors. (No one funds a lunar hotel if land rights are ambiguous.)
    
* **For Giants like SpaceX or Blue Origin:** Standards prevent costly conflicts. (Imagine two rovers blocking each other’s solar panels.)
    
* **For Everyone:** Shared norms mean more collaboration-like pooling data to avoid redundant experiments.
    

## **The Elephant in the (Virtual) Room: Who Enforces This?**

Here’s the hitch: the GEGSLA Framework isn’t legally binding. It’s a voluntary “playbook” for doing the right thing. Skeptics argue that without enforcement, bad actors will ignore it. But I’ve seen firsthand how peer pressure works in tech.

Open-source software thrives because no one wants to be the developer who breaks the community’s trust. Similarly, companies adopting GEGSLA’s guidelines gain credibility. (Try selling “sustainable lunar mining” to ESG investors without them.)

The framework also nudges nations to formalize agreements through COPUOS-the UN’s space committee-where Nigeria and other developing countries have equal voting rights.

## **What’s Next? From Zoom Calls to Lunar Colonies**

Since that UN session, GEGSLA has entered its “operational phase.” We’re workshopping the framework with startups, hosting webinars for emerging space nations, and pushing for an **Action Team on Lunar Activities Consultation (ATLAC)**\-a COPUOS group to troubleshoot disputes.

But the real work is cultural. We’re shifting from a zero-sum “space race” to a mindset of **shared destiny**. When I think about the future, I picture:

* A Nigerian engineer tweaking a lunar rover design from her Lagos coworking space.
    
* A Vietnamese startup using GEGSLA guidelines to secure funding for a Moon-based solar farm.
    
* Astronauts from Brazil and India sharing data on lunar water extraction.
    

## **Final Thought: Space Is the Ultimate Collaboration**

My journey from Lagos to Strasbourg to a UN Zoom grid taught me one thing: the next era of space won’t be defined by rockets alone. It’ll be shaped by **policy, partnerships, and the quiet power of showing up-even virtually**.

The GEGSLA Framework isn’t perfect. But like the early internet protocols that let incompatible computers communicate, it’s a starting point. And sometimes, just showing up-with a bold idea, a Nigerian accent, and a stable Wi-Fi connection-is enough to change the game.

So here’s to the dreamers, the coders, and the diplomats. The Moon is waiting. Let’s build a future there that’s worthy of the best of humanity-*all* of humanity.
