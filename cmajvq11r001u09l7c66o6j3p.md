## From Nice to Europa-Park and Into the Heart of Cloud Innovation

CloudFest 2025 was more than just a conference-it was an experience that started the moment I left home. As someone passionate about cloud technology and the WordPress ecosystem, attending this event in Europa-Park, Rust, Germany, was a bucket-list moment. Let me take you through my journey, from the logistics of getting there to the electric atmosphere inside the park, and why CloudFest is truly unlike any other tech gathering.

### Getting There: Planes, Trains, and Cloud Shuttles

My CloudFest adventure began with a flight from Nice to Strasbourg (SXB), one of the closest airports to Rust. From there, I hopped on a train, soaking in the scenic beauty of the Black Forest region as I made my way toward the small but vibrant town of Rust. The journey itself was smooth and surprisingly enjoyable-Strasbourg’s connections to Ringsheim and Offenburg make getting to Europa-Park easier than you’d expect, even if it feels like you’re heading to the middle of nowhere.

Arriving at the train station, I was greeted by the dedicated CloudFest shuttle service-a lifesaver for attendees. These shuttles run frequently, connecting key train stations directly to Europa-Park and the official conference hotels. The anticipation built as the bus wound its way through Rust, finally delivering us to the gates of what would be our home for the week.

### First Impressions: Europa-Park as a Tech Wonderland

Europa-Park is not your average conference venue. Imagine Disneyland, but with a distinctly European flair and a tech twist. The park is massive, colorful, and buzzing with excitement-especially when 8,000+ cloud professionals descend for CloudFest. The energy was palpable from the moment I stepped in.

Navigating the park was part of the adventure. Whether taking the scenic monorail, strolling through the picturesque streets of Rust, or catching a shuttle between hotels and sessions, every route offered a new perspective and a chance to bump into fellow attendees. The logistics team deserves a medal for keeping everything running smoothly.

### The Event: A Festival of Ideas and Connections

CloudFest isn’t just about keynotes and booths (though there were plenty of both). It’s a true festival, with a schedule packed from morning to night. Here are some highlights from my week:

* **Hackathon Kickoff:** The event opened with a Hackathon, drawing developers and open-source enthusiasts to collaborate on projects that could shape the future of cloud services. Even as a spectator, the buzz of creativity was infectious.
    
* **WordPress Day:** March 17 was all about WordPress, with sessions focused on AI, security, and agency growth. It was inspiring to see leaders from Automattic, Elementor, and other major players sharing insights and pushing boundaries.
    
* **Expo and Sessions:** With over 80 talks, fireside chats, and masterclasses, there was never a dull moment. The new WP Zone was a particular highlight, serving as the epicenter for WordPress innovation and community.
    
* **Networking Like Nowhere Else:** CloudFest’s legendary parties-Come2Gather, Shamrock Shake, ConneXion, and BierFest-were more than just fun; they were where real connections happened. Whether at a themed party or an impromptu gathering at the Colosseo Bar, I met people who are shaping the future of the internet.
    

### Practical Tips for Future Attendees

* **Plan Your Journey:** Book your flights and trains early, and check the CloudFest shuttle schedule for seamless transfers.
    
* **Stay Charged:** The CloudFest app is essential for networking, so bring a power bank to keep your devices alive.
    
* **Map Out Meetings:** With so many attendees, scheduling meetings in advance (and sticking to CET time!) is crucial for meaningful conversations.
    
* **Enjoy the Park:** Don’t rush-take time to explore Europa-Park itself. The setting is half the magic.
    

### Reflections: Why I’ll Be Back

CloudFest 2025 was a whirlwind of innovation, learning, and genuine human connection. From the moment I boarded my flight in Nice to the late-night conversations in Rust, every part of the journey reinforced why this event is a must for anyone in the cloud or web hosting industry. It’s not just about technology-it’s about the people, the ideas, and the unforgettable memories created along the way.
