*Distilling the All-in Pod discussion*

There was a rumour that Google is considering a bid to acquire HubSpot

HubSpot is a customer platform that connects the tools businesses need to deliver customer experiences. It is a CRM that blends marketing and sales. Google with a $2 Trillion market cap needs no introduction but I’ll say that their ad revenue hit $237.8 billion in 2023. As of May 2024, HubSpot has a $34 billion market cap. Hubspot shareholders could expect a purchase price of approximately $50 billion if Google pays a premium on this.

*Here, I’ll discuss what this acquisition means for Google's network of advertisers and Hubspot customers.* 

**TL;DR, Google has ad data but doesn’t have sales data**

#### Hubspot

Today Hubspot provides integrated marketing automation software like CRM tools and email marketing. Whenever you run ads and generate leads from ad platforms like Facebook, google etc..your sales team and the marketing team would generally use a CRM like Salesforce, Hubspot etc to track and manage the leads to convert them.

#### Google 

According to David Friedberg when he worked at Google in 2005 the main thing he worked on was how to provide more tools for advertisers. One of those deals included acquiring Urchin in 2005 which later became Google Analytics. This allowed companies to better track how leads were converting on their website after they spent marketing dollars on Google.

Google also considered acquiring a CRM like Salesforce led by Mark Benoff, although it was richly valued and had IPOed. And NetSuite which was eventually rolled in by Larry Ellison into Oracle for $9.3 billion in November 2016.

They considered a few other CRM companies in search of the next solution that you plug into the advertising including checkout software before the launch of Google Checkout which wasn’t too successful.

#### Strategic relevance 

As I mentioned earlier Google made roughly a quarter trillion dollars last year in advertising revenue and then they didn't make much revenue after the advertising generated leads.

#### Regulatory Scrutiny 

The M&A world today is almost non-existent, there is a lot of scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission especially when the purchasing party is in the “four commas’ club” i.e. companies worth over a trillion dollars.

Looking at the failed Adobe-Figma or the very successful Meta-Instagram in these examples, the acquisitions were defensive because it was about taking out a competitor and safeguarding their market position. 

#### Protecting the ad business 

But in a conventional sense, Hubspot isn’t a competitor to Google’s ad network businesses. This acquisition would likely be viewed differently because it expands Google’s market presence and capabilities in the marketing and sales software industry. With this Google improves its ad targeting and gives advertisers more tools that can integrate with the AdWords platform as a result it locks the advertisers in and reinforces the status quo. By keeping the advertisers more engaged Google protects its ad Revenue from leakage. 

HubSpot makes two billion in Revenue so it's 1% of the size of Google's ad business. Friedberg makes the point that selling CRM services may be generally lucrative but in this case, the marginal impact they'll get from this SaaS is not that impactful to the business.

#### Vendor Lock-in

Sachs wonders what Google accomplishes here that they couldn't do with an integration or a partnership. And yes there already exists a connector between Google ads going to make it a roach motel lock-in you get in and you can't get out because the full life cycle of the advertiser exists within the same ecosystem.

This move would enable Google to offer an end-to-end marketing solution, combining its strong advertising platform with HubSpot’s CRM and marketing automation tools.

#### Contrarian view 

Companies use HubSpot to manage their pipelines it's a competition to Salesforce due to its ease of use and user-friendliness and the main thing it does is you have your pipeline in there you bring in the leads at the top of the funnel and work them down to close deals where do those leads come from I understand that they can come from Google AdWords but if you're one of the customers of HubSpot Google AdWords is just one of several channels you could be getting your leads through inbound you could be getting your leads through events you could be getting your leads through I mean there's so many. 

#### Closing the loop

JCal makes the case that the key piece to this is the data. There are the leads and the great contacts in the database of the customer which Google doesn't have access to they can close the loop and they can improve the targeting of ads, get people deeper and fight for a larger percentage. 

For example, you've got 20 different inbound leads coming. If Google knows the leads in your sales pipeline, and at what stage of the sales funnel they are in, or just identifies your 10,000 best customers and thousands of others not fully converted and also knows when they're on Google search, in a Chrome browser, on an Android device, Google Display Network (GDN), YouTube Ads etc. The leads can be retargeted across Google’s entire ad Network which is the largest in the world. And you get to spend more of your ad dollars to fully convert those leads.

#### Sales data

We can deduce that this deal is not about the SaaS business it is about the data that can be used to retarget prospects and close more sales.

However, Chamath raises the question of ethics and whether companies will allow Google to use their customers' data. In reality, if Google tells you you have 20,000 people in your CRM database 8,000 of whom came in through Google search, do you want to go find the other 12,000 across Google’s ecosystem? It is a no-brainer. It could be more efficient than TikTok and Facebook/meta. This recursive loop and data on sales are how Amazon, Uber and Instacart have become major players in advertising.

#### Product Integration and ROI

Friedberg says that just improving conversion rates drives more ad revenue and the key measurement within Google the year after they bought urchin and launched Google Analytics was how much advertisers spent on Google's AdWords Network before and after they installed Google Analytics and that year they saw an incremental $500 million in Revenue in ad spend.

HubSpot has 205,000 customers as of the end of 2023 and Google AdWords has 1.2 million businesses paying $2000 on average these advertisers do not 100% overlap with Hubspot customers but if Google can drive 5% of those to use Hubspot and to spend 10% to 30% more on ad it would pay for the acquisition over a short period.
