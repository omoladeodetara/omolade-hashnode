es integrated marketing automation software like CRM tools and email marketing. Whenever you run ads and generate leads from ad platforms like Facebook, google etc..your sales team and the marketing team would generally use a CRM like Salesforce, Hubspot etc to track and manage the leads to convert them.

#### Good Friedberg when he worked at Google in 2005 the main thing he worked on was how to provide more tools for advertisers. One of those deals included acquiring Urchin in 2005 which later became Google Analytics. This allowed companies to better track how leads were converting on their website after they spent marketing dollars on Google.\\nGoogle also considered acquiring a CRM like Salesforce led by Mark Benoff, although it was richly valued and had IPOed. And NetSuite which was eventually rolled in by Larry Ellison into Oracle for $9.3 billion in November 2016.\\nThey considered a few other CRM companies in search of the next solution that you plug into the advertising including checkout software before the launch of Google Checkout which wasn’t too successful.\\n&lt;img src="[https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715791760115/582b43ac-7318-4911-954f-74d954c87199.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715791760115/582b43ac-7318-4911-954f-74d954c87199.png)" alt class="image--center mx-auto" /&gt;\\n

#### Strategic relevance\\nAs I mentioned earlier Google made roughly a quarter trillion dollars last year in advertising revenue and then they didn't make much revenue after the advertising generated leads.\\n

#### Regulatory Scrutiny\\nThe M&A world today is almost non-existent, there is a lot of scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission especially when the purchasing party is in the “four commas’ club” i.e. companies worth over a trillion dollars.\\nLooking at the failed Adobe-Figma or the very successful Meta-Instagram in these examples, the acquisitions were defensive because it was about taking out a competitor and safeguarding their market position. \\n

#### Protecting the ad business\\nBut in a conventional sense, Hubspot isn’t a competitor to Google’s ad network businesses. This acquisition would likely be viewed differently because it expands Google’s market presence and capabilities in the marketing and sales software industry. With this Google improves its ad targeting and gives advertisers more tools that can integrate with the AdWords platform as a result it locks the advertisers in and reinforces the status quo. By keeping the advertisers more engaged Google protects its ad Revenue from leakage. \\nHubSpot makes two billion in Revenue so it's 1% of the size of Google's ad business. Friedberg makes the point that selling CRM services may be generally lucrative but in this case, the marginal impact they'll get from this SaaS is not that impactful to the business.\\n

#### Vendor Lock-in\\nSachs wonders what Google accomplishes here that they couldn't do with an integration or a partnership. And yes there already exists a connector between Google ads going to make it a roach motel lock-in you get in and you can't get out because the full life cycle of the advertiser exists within the same ecosystem.\\nThis move would enable Google to offer an end-to-end marketing solution, combining its strong advertising platform with HubSpot’s CRM and marketing automation tools.\\n&lt;img src="[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VZLhW\_JvWQmgzne9AEs87ifPCM\_t6Zxuo3xaW7wHiXJqX9MDdIGE0IRmkJOab59Kgu23e6pdCaw-pnMc00EqEEIvYFQ\_DZ-rUElSxqXwECv21sQ\_9P6-PsE\_kHDUIbnmEFSmSAWuwKXBKubMxwUIR4Y](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VZLhW_JvWQmgzne9AEs87ifPCM_t6Zxuo3xaW7wHiXJqX9MDdIGE0IRmkJOab59Kgu23e6pdCaw-pnMc00EqEEIvYFQ_DZ-rUElSxqXwECv21sQ_9P6-PsE_kHDUIbnmEFSmSAWuwKXBKubMxwUIR4Y)" alt /&gt;\\n

#### Contrarian view\\nCompanies use HubSpot to manage their pipelines it's a competition to Salesforce due to its ease of use and user-friendliness and the main thing it does is you have your pipeline in there you bring in the leads at the top of the funnel and work them down to close deals where do those leads come from I understand that they can come from Google AdWords but if you're one of the custome
